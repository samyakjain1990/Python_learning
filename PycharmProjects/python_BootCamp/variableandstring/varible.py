#best practice
_cats_new = "abcd"
_dogs_new = "edgh"
_ox = _cats_new + _dogs_new

# variable which needs not be touched and are generally used for private variables
__dont_touch__ 	

print(_ox)

# varaible are not always the same
print(_ox)
print(_Ox)							# This will give an error for the captial and small letters
